Look at this kepad (on this lovely Nokia 3210 phone)

In *PHP*, write a short program which takes *one* input, which is a
list of numbers of any length. This might be '589', '423', or
'179828'.

The program should then print out *every combination of letters* that
can be made using these numbers, in the order they're provided.

For '*23*' as an input this would be:

ad
ae
af
bd
be
bf
cd
ce
